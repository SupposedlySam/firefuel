### Firefuel

Kickstart development with the Firefuel Library. Simply create a `FirefuelCollection` for your model and instantly get predefined `CRUD` (create, read, update, and delete) operations. 

View the [full README](https://github.com/SupposedlySam/firefuel/tree/main/packages/firefuel), get access to [detailed documentation](http://firefuel.dev), and see the [API Reference](https://pub.dev/documentation/firefuel/latest/)

#### Want more?
See the [Medium article](https://supposedlysam.medium.com/firefuel-basics-e4d97f1685c9) where we walk you through how to install, setup, and use the package (including using subcollections).



### Firefuel Core (for internal use)

The `core` classes used in our `firefuel` library. Released as a standalone package for those wanting access to core, without all the bells and whistles of `firefuel`.
