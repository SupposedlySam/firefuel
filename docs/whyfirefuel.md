# Why Firefuel?

> Firefuel makes it easy to separate Cloud Firestore access from business logic, making your code _fast_, _easy to test_, and _reusable_.

When building production quality applications, managing user data becomes critical.

As developers we want to:

- know what collections and subcollections they have access to
- know our data will get converted into type safe code
- catch and handle errors with confidence
- have a simple, intuitive, and consistent way to interact with data.
- have many developers seamlessly working within a single code base following the same patterns and conventions.
- develop fast and reactive apps.

Firefuel was designed to meet all of these needs and many more.

The Firefuel community works hard to keep these core values in mind:

- **Simple:** Easy to understand & can be used by developers with varying skill levels.
- **Intuitive:** Help developers understand the code they're writing with intuitive names and great documentation.
- **Consistent:** Know exactly where to make changes and what to expect, with less lines of code.

Overall, Firefuel attempts to make your data layer predictable by regulating how you interact with Firebase and enforcing encapsulation throughout your interactions.
