# Why Firefuel?

> Firefuel makes it easy to separate Cloud Firestore access from business logic, making your code _simple_, _intuitive_, and _consistent_.

When building production quality applications, managing user data becomes critical.

As developers, we want to:

- know our data will get converted into type-safe code
- have a simple, intuitive, and consistent way to interact with data.
- know what collections and subcollections you have access to
- develop fast and reactive apps.

Firefuel was designed to meet all of these needs and many more.

The Firefuel community works hard to keep these core values in mind:

- **Simple:** Easy to understand & can be used by developers with varying skill levels.
- **Intuitive:** Help developers understand the code they're writing with intuitive names and great documentation.
- **Consistent:** Know exactly where to make changes and what to expect, with less lines of code.

Overall, Firefuel attempts to make your data layer predictable by regulating how you interact with Firebase and enforcing encapsulation throughout your interactions.
